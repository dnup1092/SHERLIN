SHERLIN - SHEll using voice Recognition in LINux
=======
This project is to simplify the use of Linux shell. SHERLIN will process the natural language and then convert that into sophisticated linux command.
For recognition we have used CMU Sphinix which is one of the best speech recognition. For procesing natural language we have used Multinomial Naive bayes algorithm.
